      <h2>Enclosure</h2>
      <p>Mantis Shrimps are saltwater crustaceans, meaning they need to live in saltwater. The Mantis Shrimp's punch is so powerful that it could break a glass tank, causing it to suffocate. This is why Mantis shrimps need to be kept in an acrylic tank. It is also crucial to include some sort of cave or pipe that is in complete darkness for them to molt their shells. Without complete darkness, issues like shell rot can occur, significantly impacting the health of the shrimp.</p>

      <h2>Feeding</h2>
      <p>Mantis Shrimps prefer to eat live food. Some good options include crabs, snails, clams, and smaller crustaceans. How often you should feed your mantis shrimp depends on two factors: the size of the shrimp and the size of the food you are providing.</p>

      <h2>More Info</h2>
      <p>Mantis Shrimp are highly territorial, so it is important to never stick your hand in the tank. This also means that if you get another animal, like some sort of fish to live with your mantis shrimp, there is a high chance that it will be eaten.</p>
